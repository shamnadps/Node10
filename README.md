## Node 10 Sample

Just a sample implementation to check the usage for import and export.

## Run locally.

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Navigate to `localhost:5000`

## Notes

The ESM module loader is experimental and you need to name your file with `.mjs` extension instead of `.js`

You can see the experimental flags in the `package.json` file

```
"start": "nodemon --experimental-modules index.mjs"
```
